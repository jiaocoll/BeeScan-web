# BeeScan (display side)

## Introduction

BeeScan is a cyberspace asset detection tool based on Go language. Different from other integrated tools, all asset detection parts of BeeScan are implemented by code, rather than simple tool integration, which simplifies the environment requirements for deployment. At the same time, BeeScan supports Distributed node scanning, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency of asset detection. Tools are divided into display side and scanning side. This is the display end, and the scanning end is at [BeeScan-scan](https://github.com/jiaocoll/BeeScan-scan). The separation of the display end and the scanning end can realize distributed deployment of the scanning end, thereby improving the efficiency of scanning.

The display side uses the back-end service written by the gin framework. The author's front-end is relatively poor, so the front-end does not use Vue and other technologies (after I have time to learn and then refactor), the overall project is relatively small, and what the user gets is a binary program, all static files have been packaged into the program middle.

## Features

- Full text keyword search
    - title=""
    - body=""
    - header=""
    - domain=""
    - ip=""
    -app=""
    - servername=""
    -port=""
    - country=""
    - city=""
    - org=""
    - province=""
    - region=""
    -...More search syntax waiting for you to explore

- Integrate statistical assets and associate the bound domain name assets of each IP
- Distributed scanning of scanning nodes, greatly improving efficiency
- Call nuclei vulnerability scanning, let users use their own grammar rules to search for corresponding assets from the database for vulnerability scanning
- Monitor the running status of each scanning node in real time

## Display side functions

### Asset Display

It is mainly used to display the results that have been scanned by the scanning terminal, and to perform statistics on the scanned results, including country statistics, port statistics, and service statistics. Since the database is using the elasticsearch database. Keyword full-text search is available. In addition to the first time, it also provides the function of asset export, which can export the detected assets.

> Syntaxes can be combined with && (and) and || (or)

### Task release

The task can be published by entering the target on the task publishing page. The user needs to input the target (domain name, ip, URL), port (optional), specified node (select an idle node), and task name.

### node status

On the task release page, you can view the current real-time running status of each node, Free (idle), Invaild (invalid), Running (running)

### Vulnerability Scan

On the vulnerability scanning page, enter the corresponding asset search grammar rules, enter the task name, and you can call nuclei for vulnerability scanning (currently only call nuclei, and other vulnerability scanning modules will be added later. Since POC maintenance is not easy, the call here is It has a relatively complete ecological vulnerability scanning tool.) The results of the scan are stored in the database, and then the related vulnerabilities can be viewed on the vulnerability scanning page, and the vulnerability can be searched at the same time.

### log view

You can view the running log of the display side and the running log of each scanning node. In this way, you can understand what operations the nodes have performed, or perform troubleshooting.

### Local information

Output the detailed information of the host currently running the display terminal, including (system, framework, storage space, memory usage, real-time network card network speed monitoring)

## Scanner function

### host alive

- Multi-method detection (ICMP, Ping, HTTP)


### Port detection

- tcp/udp


### Service identification

- Multi-module detection

- Different fingerprints of different services are compared to reduce repeated packet issuance and improve efficiency

- Use browser crawler detection

- Rich fingerprint library


### Regular scan

- Regularly scan old assets in the database that exceed a certain period of time to ensure the timeliness of assets


### IP attribution information

- Built-in IP attribution query database, no need for online query

## how to use

### 1. Deploy the database

For users, redis and elasticsearch databases need to be deployed

### 2. Download the binary program

Then download the running package of the corresponding system from the release, and then run the binary program. The first run will generate a config configuration file in the directory where the tool is located, and then modify the address and port of the database in the configuration file. Then run the binary program directly. Of course, maybe you need to know the configuration information in config, because it contains the information of the node.

## expect

At present, the project is only a prototype. Later, we will consider refactoring the entire project and strive to make the project more complete. I hope you can give a star:star: to encourage the author to continue to develop :smile:.
